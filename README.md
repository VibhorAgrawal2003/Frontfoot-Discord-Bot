<p align="center">
    Frontfoot is a friendly Discord bot that brings more fun and personality to your server. It's like having your very own butler, chef, and pal all in one! 
    The bot responds to simple commands to cook dishes, serve drinks, tell corny jokes, and much more.
</p>

<p align="center">
    Designed as a fun personal project, Frontfoot stays clear of administrative tasks and uses keywords like <strong>'ff'</strong> or <strong>'hey ff'</strong> to respond, ensuring it doesn't interfere with any other popular bots in your server.
</p>

    If you've enjoyed having Frontfoot in your server, don't forget to give this repository a star! ‚≠ê
