*As the command registered in his processor, ff knew what he was programmed to do. As asked by the user, he pulled out a dynamite and exploded '{victim}'.*
*Dramatic music played in the background as ff slowly turned to face '{victim}' and then blasted them with a comically large handcannon.*
*Only seconds passed and all that remained of '{victim}' was their tiny bits and pieces after they stepped on the landmine that ff had conveniently placed a step away from them.*
*Maniacal laughter eerily erupted from the bot as ff lost control of its programming and engulfed '{victim}' with the red flames coming from a military flamethrower.*
*Without saying any words, ff launched a bunch of tiny grenades towards '{victim}' and turned them into black ash.*
